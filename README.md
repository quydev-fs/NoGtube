# NoGNightly
This branch isn't depend on `main`, but a parallel development branch with `main`
---
## Then what the heck is this?
This branch serve as a **sandbox** for development process, so its very buggy

As a development sandbox, of course it contain these:
- Unreleased features [Experimental]
- Test stuff
- Breaking changes (continuously commit)

## How 2 try
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quydev-fs/NoGtube.git
cd NoGtube
git checkout nightly
```
> Thing of it like a experimental branch, new features of the NoGtube come from here
